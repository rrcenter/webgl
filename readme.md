# Why using WebGL

Why using WebGL for learning:

1. Based on web technology: WebGL is based on web technology and doesn't require compilation or configuring a development environment, making it easy for developers to learn and get started.

2. Cross-platform support: WebGL can run on different platforms and devices without worrying about operating system and hardware differences, ensuring better compatibility.

3. Dynamic interactivity: WebGL enables dynamic, interactive rendering of graphics, providing more immersive learning experiences that are easier to understand and remember.

4. Close to OpenGL ES technology: Another advantage of using WebGL for learning is that it enables developers to get closer to OpenGL ES technology, since WebGL's underlying rendering technology is based on OpenGL ES. Therefore, learning WebGL is also learning OpenGL ES, which is a valuable opportunity for developers who want to learn about graphics rendering technology on mobile devices. Additionally, since WebGL is based on web technology, it can be learned and tested directly in a browser over the internet, without installing any additional development environment.
